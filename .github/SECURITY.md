## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report vulnerabilities either submit a private report using the ***Report a vulnerability*** button on the [Security](https://github.com/WanderingStag/WSTools/security "WSTools Security") page or publicly by opening an issue on the [Issues](https://github.com/WanderingStag/WSTools/issues "WSTools Issues") page. Both options require you to have a GitHub account.
