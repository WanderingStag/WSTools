Known issues:
1. Get-NICInfo doesn't always run.
2. There is a Microsoft bug that prevents setting some SCHANNEL values to 0xFFFFFFFF (enabled). The known items that are used at this time are SHA and PKCS. This causes some functions to throw errors and those values have to be manually set through the user interface. Bug has existed since at least 2006.
