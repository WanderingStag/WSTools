Known issues:
1. Get-NICInfo doesn't always run.
2. There is a Microsoft bug that prevents setting some SCHANNEL values to 0xFFFFFFFF (enabled). The known items that are used at this time are SHA and PKCS. This causes some functions to throw errors and those values have to be manually set through the user interface. Bug has existed since at least 2006. The workaround for this is to import a .reg file (which has been implemented in this module).

While built-in snippets don't work as well, they do work. Some exceptions apply. help, function, and switch are still duplicate snippets that I cannot live without my version of.
5. Changed files to utf8NoBOM for better interoperability. This may cause problems on older PowerShell versions. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_character_encoding?view=powershell-5.1
6. Corrected some characters in Get-Accelerator that got messed up after doing encoding change.
