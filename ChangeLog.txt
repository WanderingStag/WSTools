Known issues:
1. Get-OperatingSystem displays computers as 32-bit when running the command against a computer the logged in user does not have admin rights on.

Bug fixes:
1. Cleared a lot of issues relating to syntax of commands, $null syntax, as well as the way variables are cleared in some functions.
2. Fixed issues with Get-OperatingSystem displaying the OS twice for remote computers. Also fixed issue with
    Windows 10 v1909 not displaying properly in some instances.
3. Fixed a variable name in Get-ENSStatus that was causing issues getting the status of remote computers.

New features and other changes:
1. Copy-PowerShellJSON: copies the powershell.json file from %ModulePath% to %AppData%\Roaming\Code\User\Snippets for the currently logged on user
    allowing them to easily setup the Visual Studio Code Snippets.
2. Added the README markdown file.
3. Started a changelog.
4. Added a config file for the WSTools module so settings can be modified easily. Mainly for use internally in functions. Started converting 
    some functions to work with the new config file.
5. Added Set-WSToolsConfig function with aliases Open-WSToolsConfig and Update-WSToolsConfig.
6. Modified Install-Patches to use the InstallRemote.ps1 file in the WSTools module folder instead of a file on a file server. Also copied the
    updated Get-InstalledPrograms and Join-File functions to InstallRemote.ps1.
7. Added Set-Preferences function (pulls from values in config.ps1.)
8. Wrote Get-NetworkLevelAuthentication and Set-NetworkLevelAuthentication (aliases Get-NLA and Set-NLA respectively) using registry key methods. 
    Removed the 3rd party functions with same names that used CimInstance methods as they were unreliable on secure networks and could not get 
    WMIInstance methods to work.
9. Added Get-Errors function which will display information on errors in the current session. Removed the Get-PowerShellErrorLog function as it was inop.
10. Added error checking to some functions and more detailed error checking to some that previously had error checking.
11. Added Register-ADSIEdit function. Changed Open-ADSIEdit to try registering the dll automatically if it is not registered already but installed.

13. Added aliases to several functions. To many to list.
14. Added function Get-LocalUsers which works on local and remote computers (not to be confused with the built-in Get-LocalUser that only works on a 
    local computer.)

16. Added Set-DirtyShutdown which will clear a dirty shutdown and prevent the Shutdown Tracker from continually showing up.
17. Import-MOF (added alias New-WMIFilter) was changed to now add a WMI Filter to Active Directory instead of just read the file.
